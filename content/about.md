My name is Kim Nielsen and I work as a DevOps engineer using [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Go](https://golang.org/). As you might notice I also have a strong interest in security.

Started quite early programming demos (https://www.scene.org/). Never had the strong urge to play games but building the graphics around a game was fun. This started with Basic, Pascal and then moved to C and x86 assembly language.
