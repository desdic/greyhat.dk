Hi,

Iâ€™m a system administrator with a background as a programmer. Strong interest in computer security.

Started quite early programming demos (https://www.scene.org/). Never had the strong urge to play games but building the graphics around a game was fun. This started with Basic, Pascal and then moved to C and x86 assembly language.
