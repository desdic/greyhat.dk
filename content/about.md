My name is Kim Nielsen and I work as a system engineer using various tools like [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org) and you might have noticed I also have a strong interest in security.

Started quite early programming demos (https://www.scene.org/). Never had the strong urge to play games but building the graphics around a game was fun. This started with Basic, Pascal and then moved to C and x86 assembly language.
